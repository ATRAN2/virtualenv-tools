Manually tested, for now:

 1. no arguments prints help
 1. only one line of output by default
 1. show all changes with --verbose
 1. change is quick-idempotent
 1. idempotent change is success
 1. bad pyc file shows which file is bad
 1. bad symlink doesn't explode
 1. directory in bin/ doesn't explode
 1. failure results in retry on subsequent run
